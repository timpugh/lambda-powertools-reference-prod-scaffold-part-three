# TODO

Items that would improve this project for production use but are not yet implemented.

## Infrastructure

- [ ] **Multi-environment CDK stacks** — separate dev/staging/prod stacks with environment-specific config (SSM paths, AppConfig environments, DynamoDB table names)
- [ ] **API Gateway throttling** — add rate limiting and burst limits to prevent abuse
- [x] **WAF** — WAF WebACL deployed in `HelloWorldWafStack` and attached to CloudFront. AWS managed rule sets (IP reputation, CRS, known bad inputs) and a rate-limit rule per IP are active. WAF is not attached directly to API Gateway because the CloudFront layer already enforces it for all browser traffic.
- [ ] **SSM SecureString** — store the greeting parameter as a `SecureString` (KMS-encrypted) rather than plaintext. Note: CloudFormation does not support creating SecureString parameters, so this would require a custom resource or out-of-band provisioning.
- [ ] **Parameterise the SSM path** — pass the parameter path through CDK context rather than deriving it from the stack name
- [ ] **AppConfig initial value management** — manage the feature flag hosted configuration outside the CDK stack so it can be updated independently of a deployment

## Observability

- [ ] **CloudWatch alarms** — add alarms for Lambda error rate, p99 latency, and DynamoDB throttles, with SNS notifications
- [ ] **Dead letter queue (DLQ)** — configure a DLQ on the Lambda function to capture failed invocations
- [ ] **Structured error reporting** — integrate with an error tracking service (e.g. Sentry) for aggregated error visibility

## CI/CD

- [ ] **Deploy workflow** — GitHub Actions workflow to run `cdk deploy` on merge to `main` (deliberately deferred)
- [ ] **CDK diff on PRs** — run `cdk diff` in CI on pull requests to surface infrastructure changes before merge
- [x] **CDK synth in CI** — `cdk-check` CI job runs `cdk synth` (catching unsuppressed cdk-nag findings) and `aws_cdk.assertions.Template` tests that verify key security properties of each synthesized stack
- [ ] **Live integration tests in CI** — run API Gateway and CloudFront integration tests against a deployed dev stack as part of the CI pipeline (blocked on Deploy workflow above)

## Security

- [ ] **API Gateway authentication** — add an API key, IAM auth, or Cognito authorizer to restrict access
- [ ] **Lambda least-privilege IAM** — tighten the Lambda execution role to the minimum required permissions per resource
- [ ] **VPC placement** — place the Lambda function inside a VPC if it needs to access private resources
- [ ] **CORS origin restriction** — the Lambda handler uses `allow_origin="*"`. In production, restrict to the specific CloudFront domain and set `allow_credentials=True` if cookies or Authorization headers are needed.
- [ ] **Narrow the CDK bootstrap permissions** — the default `cdk bootstrap` creates a `CloudFormationExecutionRole` with `AdministratorAccess`. Any identity that can `sts:AssumeRole` into the deployment roles (by default, any principal in the account) can do anything in the account during deploy. Fine for a solo-dev laptop, a headache for organizations. Fix path: re-bootstrap with `cdk bootstrap --custom-permissions-boundary <POLICY_NAME>` so CFN can do anything inside the boundary but can't escape it (e.g., can't attach `AdministratorAccess` or create roles that bypass the boundary). At the org level, use SCPs via AWS Organizations to prevent tampering with the boundary. Restrict who can assume `DeploymentActionRole` to the CI role + named humans. **Sequence this before the Deploy workflow above** — once CI gets credentials that can assume the bootstrap roles, the admin default becomes a real blast radius.
- [ ] **Enforce TLS 1.2+ minimum on both edges** — the CloudFront distribution and API Gateway both currently sit on AWS-managed default certificates (`*.cloudfront.net` and `*.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com`), which pin the TLS floor at **TLS 1.0**. Verified empirically: `curl --tls-max 1.0 https://<dist>.cloudfront.net` and the equivalent against the execute-api endpoint both complete a full handshake. The CDK code at [hello_world_frontend_stack.py:208](hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py#L208) sets `TLS_V1_2_2021` but AWS silently overrides it whenever `CloudFrontDefaultCertificate: true`. The cdk-nag rule `AwsSolutions-CFR4` correctly flags this and is intentionally suppressed at [hello_world_frontend_stack.py:463](hello_world/hello_world_frontend_stack.py#L463). **Fix path:** acquire a domain, provision an ACM certificate (CloudFront cert must live in us-east-1, API Gateway custom-domain cert lives in the API's region), attach as `viewer_certificate` / `apigateway.DomainName`, then set the strongest matching `securityPolicy` (e.g. `SecurityPolicy_TLS13_2025_EDGE` for an edge-optimized API Gateway domain, `SecurityPolicy_TLS13_1_3_2025_09` for a regional one, and `TLSv1.2_2021` minimum on CloudFront). Once the custom domain is wired and verified, remove the CFR4 suppression. Also reconsider whether the API needs to remain `EDGE` — CloudFront already fronts it, so making the backend `REGIONAL` removes the redundant edge layer and unlocks the regional `securityPolicy` set (which includes post-quantum and PFS variants).

## Code

- [ ] **Input validation on caller-facing inputs** — `enable_validation=True` is set on the `APIGatewayRestResolver` ([lambda/app.py:42](lambda/app.py#L42)) and Pydantic models drive response validation, so the framework is wired. The `/hello` route currently accepts no query string, path, or body parameters, so there is nothing to validate yet. When new routes are added that accept caller input, type-annotate the handler parameters with Pydantic-compatible types (or `Annotated[..., Query/Body]`) so Powertools enforces the schema and rejects malformed input with a 422 before any business logic runs.
