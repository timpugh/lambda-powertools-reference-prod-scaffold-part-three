"""CloudFormation template snapshot tests.

A tripwire complementing the fine-grained assertions in ``test_stacks.py``:
those check the properties that *must* hold; these fail on *any* unreviewed
change to a stack's synthesized template, catching drift the targeted
assertions don't look for (a removed resource, a flipped default, an
accidental property). Snapshots are committed under ``tests/cdk/snapshots/``; a
failure means "explain or update," never an auto-bless — pair an intentional
snapshot update with the matching fine-grained assertion in ``test_stacks.py``
so the *why* is reviewable, not just the *what*.

Asset content hashes — the per-build-volatile parts of a template (Lambda/asset
S3 keys and the parameter logical-ids CDK derives from them) — are normalized
out, so editing ``lambda/`` code doesn't churn the snapshots; the snapshot
tracks infrastructure *shape*, which is what these tests exist to pin.
(Construct logical IDs are path-derived and stable across runs;
``TestLogicalIdStability`` guards those separately.)

Regenerate after an intentional change:

    UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 make test-cdk
